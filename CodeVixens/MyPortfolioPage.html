    <h2>A Few Things About Myself</h2>
    <p>I love to be addressed as <strong>Adaeze</strong>, just as much as I love crime and horror movies. <br>Presently an undergraduate of the department of <b>Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology</b> at the University of Nigeria(Enugu Campus); in my finals though.<br> Have had an interest in <em>Tech</em> since 2019, became fully invested in it via ALX in the year 2022 till date; learning <b>Software Engineering</b> and self learning basic <i>HTML - CSS - Javascript.</i> <br> My <q>aspire to perspire</q> dream in Tech is to build something uniquely global, focused on the less fortunate and solve problems.<br> In five (5) years time, I hope to have built something <strong>worthwhile and impactful.</strong> Leading more people to discover the opportunities the internet offers generally, educative and earning potential.</p>
