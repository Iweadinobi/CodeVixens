<h4>USER LOGIN PAGE</h4>
    </header>
<h2>Lab Practical -3</h2>
 <p>1.<strong>Objective:</strong> To create a simple login page using html</p>
 <p>2.<strong>Theory:</strong> The <form> element is used to crate the form, and the action attribute which tells the browser where to send the form data when the user submits it. The method attribute is set to "post" which tells the browser to send the data in the body of the HTTP request.</p>
 <p>The <label> element is used to create a text label for the input fields, and the "for" attribute is used to associate the label with the corresponding input field. The <input> elements are used to create the text fields for the username and password. The "type" attribute is set to "text" for the username field and "password" for the password field, which tells the browser to mask the characters entered in the password field.</p>
 <p>The "required" attribute is added to the input fields, which tells the browser that these fields must be filled out before the form can be submitted. </p>
 <p>The <input type="submit"> is used to create a submit button, and the value attribute is set to "Login" which will be displayed on the button.</p>
 <p>There are several other input such as radio and checkboxes.</p>
